# GitOps Http Application Sample

## HTTP Application 
This Gitops sample provides a standard HTTP component consisting of a deployment, service and route. 

The following day 2 edit/update operations supported:
    set/get image - updates the image for this component 
    set/get replicas

Assumptions
Audience: internal RH devs (expert persona in a closed environment)
Time-bound first poc

Resources already
Existing upstream docs (outdated)

Ideas

Ingest existing upstream docs; use AI to help us know how to update/correct these faster
Point to existing repo; transform it; get some kind of Q&A to prompt people through (build on last yearâ€™s OCTO POC); allows for retraining answers in live time
Requires SME to help fine-tune
If we know how to do this the right way; do a lightspeed approach: show me the right way with examples.
Eng write usable READMEs, ingest, get comprehensive doc set, refine.
